# ComputerVisionProject
in this project we have developed an algorithm that classifies gamma-ray images generated via software for a given set of astrophysics parameters. In particular, the algorithm was trained and tested with a dataset composed of three types of images: images without gamma-ray sources (class 0), with only one sources (class 1) and with two sources (class 2). For class 1 images, the algorithms outputs also the coordinates of the source, with a maximum error of 0.1Â°, with respect to the true coordinates, which are RA (right ascension) and DEC (declination) coordinate.
